# MIUI/HYPER OS custom theme preserver
A magisk module to make *custom* themes read-only because **MIUI/HYPER OS replaces it every period of time** with the stock one because of DRM mismatch! üòê
# About boot animations‚ùï
Boot animations are **EXPERIMENTAL!** ‚ö†Ô∏è
Some DRM doesn't match when you use a custom boot animation in the *boots* folder that's why MIUI/HYPER OS **bootloops** and this should be ***used at your own risk!!!*** ‚ö†Ô∏è
# About HYPER OS
I've haven't tested it, so I don't know if it works for *Hyper OS* but on MIUI it works fine! ‚úÖ
# Unfinished action.sh
I haven't finished it, so if contribute or fork this repo, that will be appreciated! üòä
## What does it do?
Makes the theme writable again, so you can replace it if you want to!
